			<div id = "About"> <h1> About </h1> </div>
			<p> Hey, my name's Alvern. I'm a computer science undergrad from the University of Waterloo. </p>
			<p> I've primarily coded in Dart, C#, SQL, JavaScript (Node, Backbone, and jQuery), and Java, and I've deployed in Azure and AWS
				over my years of internships and full-time experience. </p>
			<p> Through those, I've built desktop and web apps, delivered mobile app features, architected a CI/CD pipeline, and written way, way too many test suites.</p>
			<p> In my free time, I like to write short stories and comics, play the guitar and piano, and maintain a 
				<a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVO45zQ_FCyBhJttipUmJYw/videos">Youtube channel</a> where I posted regular videos of
				my university life from when I moved into residence in 2016 until I graduated (remotely) in 2021. </p>

			<div id = "FE_Tier_List_Maker"> <h2> FE Tier List Maker </h2> </div>
			<p> The <a href = "https://fe-tier-list-maker.github.io/">FE Tier List Maker</a> is a way for fans of the Fire Emblem series of games to sort and rank their favourite characters. </p>
			<p> The functionality was built off of <a href = "https://github.com/quetzle/smash-apps"> an existing tier list maker for Super Smash Bros. </a> and extended to implement mobile-first responsive design, refactor the code to reuse it for other tools available on the site, and more. Check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/fe-tier-list-maker/fe-tier-list-maker.github.io">here.</a></p>
			<p> Over the years, it's received pull requests from other contributors and currently averages over 400 clicks a month through Google Search alone. </p>
			<p> You can save and load your lists as text or screenshot them to post elsewhere. It currently features over 1600 characters from 17 games, and I'm still working on new ways to search and filter them all.</p>

			<p> Goose Clicker is a proof-of-concept incremental game written in JavaScript, inspired by
				<a href = "http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a> and designed around birds and feathers. </p>
			<p> Check it out <a href = "http://acvern.github.io/gooseclicker/"> here. </a> </p>

			<div id = "youneedtocode"> <h2> @youneedtocode </h2> </div>
			<p> <strong> @youneedtocode </strong> was a Twitter bot I created using
				<a href = "http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/"> Zach Whalen's </a>
				engine in Google Spreadsheets. It tweeted to me every 24 hours with Markov chain generated
				reminders of things I could be doing instead of checking Twitter.
