			<div id = "About"> <h1> About </h1> </div>
			<p> Hey, my name's Alvern. I'm a computer science undergrad from the University of Waterloo. </p>
			<p> I've primarily coded in Dart, C#, SQL, JavaScript (Node, Backbone, and jQuery), and Java, and I've deployed in Azure and AWS
				over my years of internships and full-time experience. </p>
			<p> Through those, I've built desktop and web apps, delivered mobile app features, architected a CI/CD pipeline, and written way, way too many test suites.</p>
			<p> In my free time, I like to write short stories and comics, play the guitar and piano, and maintain a 
				<a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVO45zQ_FCyBhJttipUmJYw/videos">Youtube channel</a> where I posted regular videos of
				my university life from when I moved into residence in 2016 until I graduated (remotely) in 2021. </p>

			<div id = "FE_Tier_List_Maker"> <h2> FE Tier List Maker </h2> </div>
			<p> The <a href = "https://fe-tier-list-maker.github.io/home">FE Tier List Maker</a> is a way for fans of the Fire Emblem
										 series of games to sort and rank their favourite characters. </p>
			<p> It currently features over 1600 characters from 17 games, and I'm still working on new ways to search and filter them all. </a> </p>

			<div id = "Goose_Clicker"> <h2> Goose Clicker </h2> </div>
			<p> Goose Clicker is a proof-of-concept incremental game written in JavaScript, inspired by
				<a href = "http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a> and designed around birds and feathers. </p>
			<p> Check it out <a href = "http://acvern.github.io/gooseclicker/"> here. </a> </p>

			<div id = "youneedtocode"> <h2> @youneedtocode </h2> </div>
			<p> <a href = "https://twitter.com/youneedtocode"> @youneedtocode </a> was a Twitter bot I created using
				<a href = "http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/"> Zach Whalen's </a>
				engine in Google Spreadsheets. It tweeted to me every so often with Markov chain generated
				reminders of things I could be doing instead of checking Twitter.
